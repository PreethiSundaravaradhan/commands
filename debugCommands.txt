To debug C/C++ files in commandline in mac I prefer lldb. gdb is cool, but has many issues and bugs in macosx (specific versions of Sierra) at the time of this writting.

Quick commands:
1. To start debugging: lldb <Object file>
2. to add breakpoint: br s -f AVLTree.cpp -l 227
(line#227)
We can add multiple breakpoints

3. to list variables: frame variable --no-args

4. run - to run the code
5. to continue to next breakpoint - continue
6. go to next line step-by-step : next
7. to remove  1st breakpoint: br del 1
8. list breakpoints - br l
